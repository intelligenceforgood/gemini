# Task Manifest — Planner→Executor Handoff Contract

This document defines the **Task Manifest** format used when a Planner hands work to an Executor. A manifest is the single source of truth for _what_ gets built; the Executor implements it faithfully and does not re-plan.

## When a manifest is required

- Any task the Planner expects to take more than ~20 minutes of Executor time.
- Any task touching more than one repo.
- Any task involving migrations, new env vars, or public API changes.

Small, single-file, single-repo edits can skip the manifest and run `/work-on-task` directly.

## Scope cap: one phase per manifest

**A manifest must fit in a single Executor session and end in a single commit per touched repo.** If the work naturally decomposes into phases (A, B, C…), issue **one manifest per phase** and chain them via `/verify-handoff` between phases. Do not bundle multiple phases into one artifact.

Heuristics for splitting:

- **> ~8 Executor turns estimated** → split.
- **> 1 repo requires an independently runnable verification block** → split.
- **> 1 "commit after this step" checkpoint** in the step-by-step → split.
- **Files-to-create list > ~8 items** → split.

Violating this cap is the #1 cause of "Executor started but never committed and never ran verification" failures (see `/memories/repo/workflow-patterns.md`).

## Commit + verify discipline

Every manifest MUST include, as the final step-by-step entry:

1. Run every command in `<verification>` and paste the exit code + last ~20 lines of output into the execution report.
2. `git add -A` and commit in each touched repo with a message referencing the manifest filename.
3. Stop. Do not begin any adjacent work.

An Executor session that ends with uncommitted files or unrun verification commands is a **failed** handoff regardless of how much code was written.

## File location

- `planning/handoffs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.manifest.md` (one file per handoff), OR
- Embedded as a fenced block in an existing `planning/tasks/*.md` sprint plan.

## Required structure

Use Markdown for readability **with XML tags around contract-critical sections**. Executors are instructed to treat XML-tagged content as authoritative; surrounding Markdown is context.

````markdown
# <Task title>

<contract>
**Role:** Executor
**Planner model:** <e.g., Claude Opus 4.7>
**Manifest version:** 1
**Estimated scope:** <S | M | L>
**Repos touched:** core, ui
</contract>

## Goal

<One or two sentences. High-level "done looks like…".>

## Context

<Background the Executor needs: linked PRD, relevant architecture notes, upstream decisions.
Link to `copilot/.github/shared/architecture-cheatsheet.instructions.md` sections rather than re-stating.>

<files>
### Files to modify

- `core/src/i4g/api/review.py` — add `POST /reviews/{id}/reopen` endpoint; reuse `ReviewStore.reopen()`.
- `core/tests/unit/api/test_review.py` — add coverage for the new endpoint (success + 404).
- `ui/apps/web/...` — wire a "Reopen" button in the review detail page.

### Files to create

- `core/src/i4g/api/schemas/reopen.py` — Pydantic request/response models.

### Files NOT to touch

- `core/src/i4g/worker/**` — out of scope for this task.
  </files>

## Step-by-step

1. …
2. …
3. …

<do_not>

- Do not change the database schema.
- Do not introduce new dependencies.
- Do not refactor adjacent code, even if it looks wrong — log it in `planning/change_log.md` as a follow-up instead.
- Do not skip tests.
  </do_not>

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `conda run -n i4g pytest tests/unit/api/test_review.py -x` passes.
- [ ] `conda run -n i4g pre-commit run --files <changed files>` clean on pass 2.
- [ ] Manual: `curl -X POST .../reviews/<id>/reopen` returns 200 with expected JSON.
- [ ] UI: Reopen button appears only for closed reviews; click triggers success toast.

### Commands to run

```bash
conda run -n i4g pytest tests/unit/api/test_review.py -x
cd ui && pnpm test -- review-detail
```

## If blocked

Run `/clarify` — produce a short structured question and stop. Do not guess.

```

## Rules for the Executor

1. **Do not re-plan.** The manifest is the plan. If it's wrong, stop and `/clarify`.
2. **Treat `<contract>`, `<files>`, `<do_not>`, and `<verification>` as authoritative.** If other prose conflicts with them, the XML tags win.
3. **Stay inside the "Files to modify / create" list.** If a file outside that list needs a change, stop and `/clarify`.
4. **Every acceptance criterion must be executed and reported** in the final summary (pass/fail, with the command output).
5. **Prefer minimal change.** No refactors, no stylistic edits outside touched lines.

## Rules for the Planner

1. **Write verification as commands**, not prose. Executors follow commands more reliably than narratives.
2. **Use `<do_not>` liberally** to prevent drift — models are more obedient about explicit negatives than implicit scope.
3. **Link, don't repeat** — reference `architecture-cheatsheet.instructions.md` and `general-coding.instructions.md` by path; do not inline their content.
4. **Version the manifest** if you revise it mid-execution. Bump `Manifest version` and tell the Executor to restart from the affected step.
5. **One phase per manifest.** If the work needs phase checkpoints, it needs multiple manifests. See "Scope cap" above.
6. **Hoist shared primitives first.** If a pattern (e.g., `ProviderGate`, `SkippedResult`, a shared client base) will be reused by ≥2 modules in this or a future manifest, create its home file FIRST in the step order — do not let the Executor inline it into the first consumer.
7. **Predecessor gates check commit existence, not push state.** Write Step 1 as: "Confirm commit matching `<SHA or message prefix>` appears in `git log --oneline` of `<repo>`." Do NOT gate on `origin/main` unless this manifest's verification literally consumes a CI-built artifact (e.g., a registry image rebuilt on push). If a CI artifact IS required, write that as a SECOND, separate gate ("artifact `<X>` updated since `<predecessor commit timestamp>`") so failure modes are distinguishable.
8. **Split manifests at the local/external boundary.** If part of `<verification>` is local-deterministic (file edits, fmt, lint, unit tests, `terraform validate`) and part requires external infrastructure (`terraform plan`/`apply`, GCP/AWS API calls, cluster smoke, network egress), produce TWO manifests. The local half lands immediately and is durable; the external half files separately and triggers when the dependency is back. Bundling them produces unblockable manifests when the external dep is unavailable (billing disabled, network outage, missing creds).
9. **Default `<do_not>` additions for every manifest:**
   - "Do not delete or move files outside this manifest's `<files>` list, including prior sprint manifests."
   - "Do not re-save sections of a settings/config file you are not extending. Verify with `git diff -w` that untouched blocks show no whitespace-only diffs."
   - "Do not leave uncommitted files at end of session. If verification fails, commit a WIP with an explicit `[WIP]` prefix and stop for `/clarify`."
```
