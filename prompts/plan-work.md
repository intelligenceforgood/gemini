# Plan Work

**Role: Planner.** Take a feature request, task description, or user story and break it into implementable steps. This routine produces a plan; it does not implement. When the plan is ready, the user will either continue here (for small tasks) or run `/handoff` to produce a manifest for an Executor to pick up.

## Steps

1. **Clarify scope.** Read the task description (from planning/, a PR, or user input). If it's ambiguous, list assumptions and confirm with the user.

2. **Identify affected repos.** Determine which repos need changes (core/, ui/, ssi/, infra/, etc.) and what kind of changes (API, UI, database, infrastructure).

3. **Check architecture.** Read `.gemini/styleguide.md` for relevant patterns, especially:
   - Request routing (UI → API proxy → FastAPI)
   - Store/factory patterns
   - Worker/job patterns for background tasks

4. **Break into steps.** Create a numbered task list:
   - Order by dependency (database first, then API, then UI)
   - Each step should be independently testable
   - Flag steps that require manual actions (migrations, deploys)

5. **Identify risks.** Note:
   - Breaking changes to existing APIs or schemas
   - New environment variables (need docs + tests)
   - Database migrations (need careful sequencing)

6. **Track with todos.** Create a todo list to track progress through the steps.

7. **Decide the handoff.** Apply the skip-threshold heuristic:
   - **Skip `/handoff`, implement inline** if ANY of these hold: estimated < 8 Executor turns, < 3 files touched, single repo with no migrations/env vars/API changes, or throwaway/exploratory work. The Planner-overhead tax (roughly 2× the Planner cost for handoff + verify) only pays back on longer work.
   - **Use `/handoff`** for multi-file, multi-repo, or risky work where scope discipline matters more than speed.
   - **Batch sprints into one manifest** when possible. Don't produce one manifest per sprint when two or three sprints share a coherent slice of work — the Planner cost is mostly fixed per handoff session, so one larger manifest is far cheaper than N small ones.
